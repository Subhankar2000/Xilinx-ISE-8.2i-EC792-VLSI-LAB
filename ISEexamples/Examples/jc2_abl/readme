JC2_ABL is a bi-directional 4-bit Johnson counter with stop control.

DESIGN FLOW: Stand-alone XABEL design (JC2_TOP.ABL)

TARGET DEVICE: XC9572XL-CS48 (any speed)

I/O PINS:
	CLK   : input free-running clock 
	LEFT  : input signal to shift left (active-low switch)
	RIGHT : input signal to shift right (active-low switch)
	STOP  : input signal to stop counting (active-low switch)
	Q3-Q0 : counter outputs (active-low LEDs; Q0 is right-most)

OPERATION:
	The counter is triggered on the rising edge of the clock (CLK). 
	A low pulse on the LEFT input will cause the counter to start 
	shifting left from its current state. A low pulse on the RIGHT
	input will cause the counter to start shifting right from its 
	current state. A low pulse on the STOP input will cause the 
	counter to hold its current state until LEFT or RIGHT is pulsed.

        The following sequence appears on outputs Q3-Q0 when shifting left:
		0000
		0001
		0011
		0111
		1111
		1110
		1100
		1000
		0000 (repeats)

        The following sequence appears on outputs Q3-Q0 when shifting right:
		0000
		1000
		1100
		1110
		1111
		0111
		0011
		0001
		0000 (repeats)

	After power-up, the counter is stopped with all outputs low (LEDs lit).
 
SIMULATION:
        ABEL Test Vectors are included in JC2_TOP.ABL.
