Description: CDMA Matched filter Implementation files (EDIF) for XAPP212

The EDIF file for the parallel matched filter is provided as a reference 
design. The data width and the oversample rate for the parallel matched 
filter design are shown below. This design uses a scalable structure 
for each tap in the filter to be identical. Therefore, ensuring that the 
basic tap of the filter is properly implemented is important.
      
      InDataWidth    : integer := 8
      OutDataWidth   : integer := 16
      OverSampleRate : integer := 16

See Application Note 212 for a full functional description.
